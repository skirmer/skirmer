### Hello!

I'm a data scientist in Chicago, and you may know me from my public presentations about data science and data engineering! I love my work and I especially love sharing it with others.

#### If you'd like to peek at some of the presentations I've done in the past, you're in luck! They're all here.
* üåê [Setting Healthy Boundaries: Generating Geofences at Scale with Machine¬†Learning](https://github.com/skirmer/setting_healthy_boundaries)
* :books: [Deploying ML Models with Flask or Voila](https://github.com/skirmer/college_scorecard) 
* :wrench: [Tutorial Workshop on Functions in R](https://github.com/skirmer/functions_r)

* :fist: [Data science can be better, sociology can help!](https://github.com/skirmer/satRdays_chicago_2019)
* :shipit: [Make your own R packages, be awesome!](https://github.com/skirmer/r_packages)  
* [You can see my back history of talks as well if you're thinking "wait, what conference was it where I saw her do that thing?"](https://skirmer.github.io/events.html)

#### I also work on packages now and then - some are proprietary and belong to my workplaces, but there's some I can share:
* :joy: [radlibs: for Python or R!](https://github.com/skirmer/radlibs) (or use CRAN/pypi, it's there too)
* :fire: [dask-pytorch-ddp](https://github.com/saturncloud/dask-pytorch-ddp) a Saturn Cloud open source project I contribute to. Do pytorch on multi-machine clusters! (pypi) 

#### I do a day job too
* üöö: I am a senior machine learning engineer at [DataGrail](https://www.datagrail.io/).
* I used to work at: [project44](https://www.project44.com/), [Saturn Cloud](https://www.saturncloud.io), [Journera](http://journera.com), Uptake, the University of Chicago, and DePaul University
