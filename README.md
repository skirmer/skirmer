### Hello!

I'm a machine learning engineer in Chicago, and you may know me from my public presentations about data science, machine learning, and data engineering! I love my work and I especially love sharing it with others.

#### If you'd like to peek at some of the presentations I've done in the past, you're in luck! They're all here.
* 💼 [Decoding Data Science Roles: A guide to the different jobs data scientists (really) do](https://github.com/skirmer/ds_careers)   
* 🌐 [Setting Healthy Boundaries: Generating Geofences at Scale with Machine Learning](https://github.com/skirmer/setting_healthy_boundaries)
* 📚: [Deploying ML Models with Flask or Voila](https://github.com/skirmer/college_scorecard) 
* 🔧: [Tutorial Workshop on Functions in R](https://github.com/skirmer/functions_r)

* 🔀: [Use Elasticsearch data storage with analytics workflows](https://github.com/skirmer/elastic_analytics)  
* 🚀: [Make your data science team a well oiled machine with R](https://github.com/skirmer/team_collab)  
* 🎥: [Use animation wisely with awesome results in gganimate](https://github.com/skirmer/animating_dataviz)  
* ✊: [Data science can be better, sociology can help!](https://github.com/skirmer/satRdays_chicago_2019)
* [You can see my back history of talks as well if you're thinking "wait, what conference was it where I saw her do that thing?"](https://www.stephaniekirmer.com/speaking/)

#### I also work on packages now and then - some are proprietary and belong to my workplaces, but there's some I can share:
* :joy: [radlibs: for Python or R!](https://github.com/skirmer/radlibs) (or use CRAN/pypi, it's there too)
* :fire: [dask-pytorch-ddp](https://github.com/saturncloud/dask-pytorch-ddp) a Saturn Cloud open source project I contribute to. Do pytorch on multi-machine clusters! (pypi) 

#### I do a day job too
* 🤐: I am a staff machine learning engineer at [DataGrail](https://www.datagrail.io/).
* I used to work at: [project44](https://www.project44.com/), [Saturn Cloud](https://www.saturncloud.io), [Journera](http://journera.com), Uptake, the University of Chicago, and DePaul University
