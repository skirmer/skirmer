### Hello!

I'm a data scientist in Chicago, and you may know me from my public presentations about data science and data engineering! I love my work and I especially love sharing it with others.

#### If you'd like to peek at some of the presentations I've done in the past, you're in luck! They're all here.
* :twisted_rightwards_arrows: [Use Elasticsearch data storage with analytics workflows](https://github.com/skirmer/elastic_analytics)  
* :rocket: [Make your data science team a well oiled machine with R](https://github.com/skirmer/team_collab)  
* :movie_camera: [Use animation wisely with awesome results in gganimate](https://github.com/skirmer/animating_dataviz)  
* :fist: [Data science can be better, sociology can help!](https://github.com/skirmer/satRdays_chicago_2019)
* :shipit: [Make your own R packages, be awesome!](https://github.com/skirmer/r_packages)  

#### I also make packages now and then - some are proprietary and belong to my workplaces, but there's a fun one I can share:
* :laughing: [Make your own mad libs in Python](https://github.com/skirmer/radlibs-py) (or just get it on pypi)
* :joy: [Or in R!](https://github.com/skirmer/radlibs) (or use CRAN, it's there too)

#### :microphone: Contact me!

As anyone who knows me will tell you, there's nothing I like more than talking about data sciency things.
