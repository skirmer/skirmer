### Hello!

I'm a data scientist in Chicago, and you may know me from my public presentations about data science and data engineering! I love my work and I especially love sharing it with others.

#### If you'd like to peek at some of the presentations I've done in the past, you're in luck! They're all here.
* :deciduous_tree: [Branching Out into Isolation Forests: Tree Based Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/skirmer/isolation_forests)
* :cloud: [Learn Airflow and Redshift for ML Uses](https://github.com/skirmer/airflow_plus_redshift)
* :twisted_rightwards_arrows: [Use Elasticsearch data storage with analytics workflows](https://github.com/skirmer/elastic_analytics)  
* :rocket: [Make your data science team a well oiled machine with R](https://github.com/skirmer/team_collab)  
* :movie_camera: [Use animation wisely with awesome results in gganimate](https://github.com/skirmer/animating_dataviz)  
* :fist: [Data science can be better, sociology can help!](https://github.com/skirmer/satRdays_chicago_2019)
* :shipit: [Make your own R packages, be awesome!](https://github.com/skirmer/r_packages)  
* [You can see my back history of talks as well if you're thinking "wait, what conference was it where I saw her do that thing?"](https://skirmer.github.io/events.html)

#### I also make packages now and then - some are proprietary and belong to my workplaces, but there's a fun one I can share:
* :joy: [radlibs: for Python or R!](https://github.com/skirmer/radlibs) (or use CRAN/pypi, it's there too)

#### I do a day job too
* Starting in late September 2020 I will be joining Saturn Cloud as a senior data scientist!
* :airplane: I'm the data science technical lead at [Journera](http://journera.com)
* I used to work at: Uptake, the University of Chicago, and DePaul University

#### :microphone: Contact me!

As anyone who knows me will tell you, there's nothing I like more than talking about data sciency things.
