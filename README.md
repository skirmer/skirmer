### Hello!

I'm a machine learning engineer in Chicago, and you may know me from my public presentations about data science, machine learning, and data engineering! I love my work and I especially love sharing it with others.

#### Writing
I write a [monthly column on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/author/s-kirmer/) about AI, machine learning, and society. Please [subscribe via RSS to get it emailed to you](https://medium.com/feed/@s.kirmer)!

#### Talking
I also [give talks all over the place](https://www.stephaniekirmer.com/speaking/), and I usually make the decks available here on github. Here's a few!
* 🏢 [Just Do Something With AI: Bridging the Business Communication Gap for ML Practitioners](https://github.com/skirmer/just-do-something-with-ai)
* 💼 [Decoding Data Science Roles: A guide to the different jobs data scientists (really) do](https://github.com/skirmer/ds_careers)   
* 🌐 [Setting Healthy Boundaries: Generating Geofences at Scale with Machine Learning](https://github.com/skirmer/setting_healthy_boundaries)
* 📚: [Deploying ML Models with Flask or Voila](https://github.com/skirmer/college_scorecard) 
* 🔧: [Tutorial Workshop on Functions in R](https://github.com/skirmer/functions_r)

* ✊: [Data science can be better, sociology can help!](https://github.com/skirmer/satRdays_chicago_2019)
* [You can see my back history of talks as well if you're thinking "wait, what conference was it where I saw her do that thing?"](https://www.stephaniekirmer.com/speaking/)

#### I do a day job too
* 🤐: I am a staff machine learning engineer at [DataGrail](https://www.datagrail.io/).
* I used to work at: [project44](https://www.project44.com/), [Saturn Cloud](https://www.saturncloud.io), [Journera](http://journera.com), Uptake, the University of Chicago, and DePaul University
